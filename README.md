# Clean BLoC Template (skeleton)
This zip contains a minimal skeleton for a Flutter project using Clean Architecture + BLoC.

What it includes:
- `app/` folder (DI, router, theme)
- `core/` basic utilities
- `features/auth/` example feature (data/domain/presentation)
- `main.dart` entry

Notes:
- This is a lightweight starter skeleton to jumpstart your project.
- You should run `flutter pub get` then configure code generation:
  `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
- Add further logic, environment variables, and API details as needed.
